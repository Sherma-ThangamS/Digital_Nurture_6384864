/*

    How Arrays Are Represented in Memory:  Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations.

    Each element can be accessed using an index: address = base_address + (index Ã— size_of_element)

    Fast random access: O(1) time to access any index.

    Time Complexity : O(1)

     Limitations of Arrays in Java :
        Fixed Size
        Inefficient Deletion/Insertion requires shifting elements (O(n) time).

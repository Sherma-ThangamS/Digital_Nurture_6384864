    Answer: 

        CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE ProcessMonthlyInterest IS
        BEGIN
            UPDATE Accounts
            SET Balance = Balance + (Balance * 0.01)
            WHERE AccountType = 'Savings';

            COMMIT;
        END;

    

Scenario 2:

    Question:

    Answer:

    CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE UpdateEmployeeBonus (
        p_depart IN VARCHAR2,
        p_BonusPerc IN NUMBER
    ) IS
    BEGIN
        UPDATE Employees
        SET Salary = Salary + (Salary * (p_BonusPerc / 100))

        COMMIT;
    END;


Scenario 3:

    Answer:

    CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE TransferFunds (

        sourceAccountId in NUMBER
        targetAccountId in NUMBER,
        amount in NUMBER,

    ) 
    
    IS sourceBalance NUMBER;

    BEGIN 

        SELECT Balance INTO sourceBalance
        FROM Accounts
        WHERE AccountID=sourceAccountId
        FOR UPDATE;

        if sourceBalance < amount THEN
            RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20001, 'Insufficient funds in the source account.');
        END IF;

        UPDATE Accounts
        SET Balance=Balance - amount
        WHERE AccountID=sourceAccountId

        UPDATE Accounts
        SET Balance=Balance + amount
        WHERE AccountID=targetAccountId

        COMMIT

    END

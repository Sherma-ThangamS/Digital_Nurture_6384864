Scenario 1: 
    The bank wants to apply a discount to loan interest rates for customers above 60 years old.

    Question: 
        Write a PL/SQL block that loops through all customers, checks their age, and if they are above 60, apply a 1% discount to their current loan interest rates.


    Answer:

        begin 

            for cusId in (select id from customer where age>60) loop

                update customer
                set interest=interest*0.99
                where id=cusId

            end loop

            commit

        end



Scenario 2: 
    A customer can be promoted to VIP status based on their balance.
    
    Question: 
        Write a PL/SQL block that iterates through all customers and sets a flag IsVIP to TRUE for those with a balance over $10,000.

    Answer:

    begin 

        for cusId in (select id from customers where balance>10000) loop

            update customers
            set IsVIP=TRUE
            where id=cusId

        end loop

    end


Scenario 3: 
    The bank wants to send reminders to customers whose loans are due within the next 30 days.

    Question: 
        Write a PL/SQL block that fetches all loans due in the next 30 days and prints a reminder message for each customer.

    Answer:

        DECLARE

            CURSOR loan_cursor IS
                SELECT customer_name, loan_id, due_date
                FROM loans
                WHERE due_date BETWEEN SYSDATE AND SYSDATE + 30;

        begin
            FOR loan_rec IN loan_cursor LOOP
                DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Reminder: Loan ID ' || loan_rec.loan_id || 
                                    ' for customer ' || loan_rec.customer_name || 
                                    ' is due on ' || TO_CHAR(loan_rec.due_date, 'DD-MON-YYYY') || '.');
            END LOOP;
        END;
